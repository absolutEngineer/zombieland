Computer "game" which simulates the clash of three different character types: the Good, the Bad and the Zombie.

Initially instances of all character types are randomly created and put in a list. In each round every character attacks the next character in the list, given that the attacked is of different type than the attacker. As a result of the attack, the attacked might change type (eg from Good to Bad) or die. The simualtion ends when 100 rounds are finished, or when there is only one character type still alive.
